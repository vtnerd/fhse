/*!
  Customize backend memory functions used by fhse. `mlock` and `munlock` can
  safely be `NULL`, and the code will automatically downgrade to non-locking
  behavior. If the functions are set but `mlock` fails, the library will
  correctly error out.

  \note `realloc` and `free` only modify how fhse allocates memory; libfido2
    and libcbor use standard `malloc` and `free` that are difficult to replace.
    fhse uses the streaming interface for libcbor output, and thus only the user
    supplied `realloc` is used, but decoding/opening cbor requires system
    allocators. The primary use for the user supplied allocators is the
    potential to support `epee::byte_slice` in Monero related libs.

    This also unfortunately means `fido_userid`, `fido_salt`, and encrypted
    blobs of each FIDO2 key - which are all semi-sensitive - exist in libcbor
    memory while unpacking. Fixing this requires a custom parser or custom DOM
    objects. */
